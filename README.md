## Introduction

Are you ready to embark on a journey into the fascinating world of quantum computing? If you're new to this exciting field, you're in the right place.

This notebook will walk you through the basics of quantum mechanics, how quantum bits (qubits) are different from classical bits, how to create your first quantum circuit using Qiskit, executing your quantum circuit on a real quantum computer, and solving problems that showcase the power of quantum computing.

## What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum computing is like the superhero of the computing world. It harnesses the power of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that would take classical computers centuries to solve. Imagine solving complex problems in seconds that were once thought impossible!

## Introducing Qiskit

In this notebook, we will be using Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework developed by IBM. Qiskit is like your toolbox for quantum exploration, and it allows you to create and run quantum programs with ease.

## What You'll Learn

In this notebook, you'll discover:

- The basics of quantum mechanics.
- How quantum bits (qubits) are different from classical bits.
- How to create your first quantum circuit using Qiskit.
- Executing your quantum circuit on a real quantum computer.
- Solving problems that showcase the power of quantum computing.

## Prerequisites

You don't need to be a physicist or a mathematician to start your quantum journey. This notebook is designed for beginners, and we'll walk you through the concepts step by step.

All you need is curiosity and a bit of patience. So, are you ready to dive into the quantum realm? Let's get started!

## Getting Set Up

Before we begin, make sure you have Qiskit installed on your system. If you haven't already, you can install it by running:
```bash
pip install qiskit
```

Once you have Qiskit installed, you're all set to start your quantum adventure. Let's go!
