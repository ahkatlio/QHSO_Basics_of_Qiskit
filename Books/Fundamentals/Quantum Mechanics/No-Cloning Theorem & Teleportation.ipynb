    "    <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">No Cloning Theorem</h1>\n",
    "    <p>The No-Cloning Theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics that states that it is impossible to create an exact copy (or clone) of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. This theorem has profound implications for quantum information processing and the security of quantum communication.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Classical vs. Quantum Cloning:</h2>\n",
    "    <p>In classical information theory, it is possible to create exact copies of classical information (bits) without any limitations. For example, you can duplicate a document or a computer file as many times as you want. However, in the quantum world, things are different.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Quantum Superposition and Uncertainty:</h2>\n",
    "    <p>In quantum mechanics, a quantum state can exist in a superposition of multiple states. This means that until you measure a quantum state, it can be in a combination of different possible outcomes. Cloning such a state would require copying all possible outcomes simultaneously, which is prohibited by the No-Cloning Theorem.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Implications:</h2>\n",
    "    <p>The No-Cloning Theorem has practical implications for quantum information processing. For example, it ensures the security of quantum encryption schemes like Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), as any attempt to eavesdrop on the quantum communication channel would inevitably disturb the quantum states being transmitted, making the eavesdropping detectable.</p>\n",
    "    <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Quantum Teleportation</h1>\n",
    "    <p>Quantum teleportation is a remarkable quantum protocol that allows the transfer of quantum information (the state of a quantum system) from one location to another without physically moving the particles themselves. This process relies on the principles of quantum entanglement and is used in quantum computing and quantum communication.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Preparation of Entangled Particles:</h2>\n",
    "    <p>The process begins with the creation of an entangled pair of particles (e.g., electrons) that will serve as a quantum channel between two parties, Alice and Bob. These particles are entangled in such a way that their combined state is known, but the individual states are unknown.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>State to be Teleported:</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Alice wants to send the quantum state of a particle (let's call it \"A\") to Bob without physically sending A to him. She also needs to send two classical bits of information to Bob.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Bell Measurement:</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Alice performs a specific measurement on particle A and her part of the entangled pair. This measurement yields two classical bits of information based on the outcome.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Classical Information Transmission:</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Alice communicates the results of her measurement to Bob using classical communication channels.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Bob's Operation:</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Armed with the classical information from Alice's measurement and his part of the entangled pair, Bob performs a quantum operation on his particle (let's call it \"B\"). This operation effectively transforms B into a perfect copy of A, effectively \"teleporting\" the quantum state of A to B. Result: After Bob's operation, particle B assumes the same quantum state that particle A originally had, and this state is now located with Bob.</p>\n",
