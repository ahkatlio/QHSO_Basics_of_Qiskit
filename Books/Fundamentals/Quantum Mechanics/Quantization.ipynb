    "## 1. Quantization of Energy ##\n",
    "In classical physics, energy is considered continuous, meaning it can take any value. However, in quantum mechanics, energy levels are quantized, which means they can only have specific discrete values. This quantization of energy was first proposed by Max Planck."

    "## 3. Emission and Absorption of Light ##\n",
    "When an electron transitions from a higher energy level (e.g., n = 2) to a lower energy level (e.g., n = 1), it releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, typically visible light. This is known as emission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, when an electron absorbs energy from external sources, it can move to a higher energy level. This results in the absorption of specific wavelengths of light, which can be used to identify elements or molecules."
