    "    <p>In classical physics, energy is considered continuous, meaning it can take any value. However, in quantum mechanics, energy levels are quantized, which means they can only have specific discrete values. This quantization of energy was first proposed by Max Planck.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Planck proposed that energy is quantized in the form of small packets called quanta. The energy of a quantum is given by the equation:</p>\n",
    "    <p style=\"text-align: center;\">E = hν</p>\n",
    "    <p>where E is the energy of the quantum, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of the quantum.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Planck's constant is a physical constant that is the quantum of electromagnetic action, which relates the energy carried by a photon to its frequency. It is denoted by the symbol h and has a value of 6.62606957 × 10<sup>-34</sup> J·s.</p>\n",

    "    <p>The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom was proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913. It is a quantum-mechanical model of the hydrogen atom that describes the atom as a nucleus surrounded by electrons that travel in circular orbits around the nucleus, similar to the structure of the Solar System. In the Bohr model, an electron orbits the nucleus in specific energy levels, represented by integer values of n. These energy levels are also referred to as electron shells. The energy of an electron in the nth orbit is given by:</p>\n",

    "    <p>The principal quantum number is also referred to as the principal quantum level or energy level. The principal quantum number is related to the size and energy of an orbital. As the principal quantum number increases, the size and energy of the orbital increases. The principal quantum number also determines the number of subshells in an orbital. The number of subshells in an orbital is equal to the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number is also related to the number of electrons in an orbital. The number of electrons in an orbital is equal to 2n<sup>2</sup>. The principal quantum number is also related to the number of nodes in an orbital. The number of nodes in an orbital is equal to n-1.</p>\n",

    "    <p>When an electron transitions from a higher energy level (e.g., n = 2) to a lower energy level (e.g., n = 1), it releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, typically visible light. This is known as emission.Conversely, when an electron absorbs energy from external sources, it can move to a higher energy level. This results in the absorption of specific wavelengths of light, which can be used to identify elements or molecules.</p>\n",

    "    <p>In our journey through the fascinating world of quantum physics, we've delved into the concept of quantization, where we discovered that certain properties, like energy levels in atoms, are quantized into discrete values. This phenomenon challenges our classical intuitions and unveils the remarkable behavior of the quantum world. Now, as we venture deeper into the quantum realm, we'll explore another mind-boggling concept that's closely related—wave-particle duality. Just as quantization shook the foundations of classical physics, wave-particle duality blurs the lines between what we think of as particles and waves. It's a concept that revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the universe. In the next notebook, we'll unravel the mysteries of wave-particle duality, witnessing how particles, like electrons and photons, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This duality is a cornerstone of quantum physics, and it's essential for comprehending the behavior of quantum entities. Get ready to embark on this next chapter of our quantum exploration as we unlock the secrets of wave-particle duality and its profound implications for our understanding of the quantum world!</p>\n",
