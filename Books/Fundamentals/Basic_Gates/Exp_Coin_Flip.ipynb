    "    <p>Welcome to the world of quantum computing, where we're about to embark on an exciting journey into the fascinating realm of quantum coin flips! ðŸª™ In this section, we'll conduct a series of experiments using a special kind of coin, a quantum coin represented as a qubit. Unlike regular coins, these quantum coins have a magical property â€“ they can be in multiple states at once until we observe them.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>What is the X-Gate (Bit Flip)?</h2>\n",
    "    <p>The X-gate is a bit like a trickster. If your qubit is in the \"OFF\" state, represented as âˆ£0âŸ©, the X-gate will quickly turn it \"ON\", making it âˆ£1âŸ©. On the other hand, if your qubit is already \"ON\" as âˆ£1âŸ©, the X-gate will play another trick and turn it \"OFF\" to âˆ£0âŸ©.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Imagine a Toggle Switch</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Imagine your qubit as a tiny lightbulb. If it's off, the X-gate flips the switch, and the light turns on. If it's already on, the X-gate flips it again, and the light turns off. It's like having a remote control for your quantum light!</p>\n",
