    "    <p>In this notebook, we'll explore an exciting concept called \"rotation gates.\" These gates are like magic wands that allow us to turn and twist quantum bits (qubits) in precise ways. Let's dive in!</p>\n",
    "    <h2>What are Rotation Gates?</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Rotation gates are like compasses for qubits. They let us rotate a qubit's state around different axes (like turning a spinning top). We have three main types of rotation gates: Rx, Ry, and Rz.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Introducing Qiskit</h2>\n",
    "    <p>In this notebook, we will be using <strong>Qiskit</strong>, an open-source quantum computing framework developed by IBM. Qiskit is like your toolbox for quantum exploration, and it allows you to create and run quantum programs with ease.</p>\n",
    "    <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>\n",
    "    <p>In this notebook, you'll discover:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>The basics of quantum mechanics.</li>\n",
    "        <li>How quantum bits (qubits) are different from classical bits.</li>\n",
    "        <li>How to create your first quantum circuit using Qiskit.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Executing your quantum circuit on a real quantum computer.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Solving problems that showcase the power of quantum computing.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n",
    "    <p>You don't need to be a physicist or a mathematician to start your quantum journey. This notebook is designed for beginners, and we'll walk you through the concepts step by step.</p>\n",
    "    <p>All you need is curiosity and a bit of patience. So, are you ready to dive into the quantum realm? Let's get started!</p>\n",
    "    <h2>Getting Set Up</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Before we begin, make sure you have Qiskit installed on your system. If you haven't already, you can install it by running:</p>\n",
    "    <code>pip install qiskit</code>\n",
    "    <p>Once you have Qiskit installed, you're all set to start your quantum adventure. Let's go!</p>\n",
    "    <p>Happy Quantum Computing! ðŸŒŒ</p>\n",
