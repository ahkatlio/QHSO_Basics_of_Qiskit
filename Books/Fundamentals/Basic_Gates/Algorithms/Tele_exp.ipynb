In this notebook, we're going to embark on an incredible journey where we'll learn how to teleport quantum information from one place to another using the magic of quantum entanglement. Get ready for an adventure like no other! And we will also run our circuit to a real IBM Quantum Computer</p>\n",

    "    <p>Imagine being able to send a quantum state (a qubit) to your friend, instantly! That's what quantum teleportation allows us to do. It's like teleporting in your favorite sci-fi movies, but with quantum information. <br>Here's the catch: we can't just copy and paste quantum states like regular information. Instead, we use a combination of three qubits and some quantum trickery to send the information securely.</p>\n",

For this we have to create a quantum circuit with three qubits and three classic bits. The reason we need three qubits is that, one to represent the state and two that we will entangle and share with O'Neal and Jaya:</p>\n",
